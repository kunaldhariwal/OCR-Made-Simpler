# OCR-Made-Simpler
This work is the Enhanced version of @longhowlam's work for better user experience. &lt;br>  This shiny app is based on R.  You put in an image with some text and get the output as text, as well as a wordcloud!  &lt;br>  I have used **tesseract** package to get the OCR done.   &lt;br>  **Wordcloud** package to generate the work cloud.
